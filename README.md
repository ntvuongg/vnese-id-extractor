# **Vietnamese ID Card Extractor v1.0**
## **‚ùóNewer version**

Checkout[**ID Card Extractor v2.0**](https://github.com/ntvuongg/vnese-id-extractor-v2)

## **Introduction**

An ID Card extraction tool using **Keras** models which is implementation of [**YOLOv4**](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) (Tensorflow backend) for detection and [**VietOCR**](https://github.com/pbcquoc/vietocr) for recognition.

## **Tutorial**

I highly recommend you performing on virtual environment by using [**Anaconda**](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).

### **Activating your virtual environment**

```
conda activate [your_venv_name]
```

### **Cloning repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/ntvuongg/vnese-id-extractor.git
```

### **Installing requirements**

```
while read setup; do conda install --yes $setup || pip install $setup || conda install --yes -c  $setup $setup; done < setup.txt
```

### **Getting weights**

You can [click here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dAK75XvXP8L32FoSc1W3fFnt80Z32f1L) to download my trained weights or get it from **gdown** module:

(You can pass below code if you have already installed **gdown**)

```
conda install gdown
```

```
gdown --id 1dAK75XvXP8L32FoSc1W3fFnt80Z32f1L
```

After downloaded weights, make sure you extract and put them in **_`vnese-id-extractor/models/weights`_**

### **Extracting your ID card**

```
conda run -n [your_venv_name] --no-capture-output --live-stream python vnese-id-extractor/deploy.py
```

First time running this will take a lot of time. So, keep waiting :)

When server is ready, you can extract your ID card by accessing below:

```

```

You can drag and drop or browse your image to drag area.

After uploaded your image of ID Card, click **Extract** button to get information from ID card.
